# International PCMorse

One up [u/Gelderland_ball's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/mhptpr/comments_may_now_only_be_based_or_cringe/) by speaking in the one and only **International P**olitical**C**ompass**Morse Code**!

Now you will both be compliant with the new rules™️ *AND* still be able to communicate with each other. Unlike my political ideology, this is PROVEN to be FOOL-PROOF!

## Usage

### General Description

This is a command line interface program, meaning all interactions are done through a terminal/console/whatever you want to call it. There's no fancy GUI with buttons or anything, just you, your keyboard, and this little program.

The program is controlled by typing in inputs into the program. From the main menu, you can either type in `0` or `1` to set your mode when prompted, then you can enter a string that the program will take in and run through the translator before it spits out the result to you.

**ONLY ACCEPTS ALPHANUMERIC CHARACTERS!** This means all the letters A - Z and all digits from 0 - 9. All other characters will be ignored and discarded.

**Input is case-insensitive.** This means entering `LIBLEFT BAD`, `libleft bad`, and `lIbLeFt BaD` will all give you the same result. This applies to both translation modes, so entering `CRINGEBASED` and `cringebased` will both give you `A`.

If enough people ask me, I'll make a "for dummies" set of instructions for using this offline, but I cba for now because I got a test tomorrow.
